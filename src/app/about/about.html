          I'm a Software Test Engineer and Developer currently located in Michigan,
          with a strong interest in building reliable software and learning new technologies
          to expand on my skill set. I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from
          Bowling Green State University. I have 2+ years of experience developing and testing
          enterprise applications, primarily in Angular and Java. During this time, I have also
          gained experience writing UI and API test automation using Java and Selenium, as well as Playwright.
          Along with my test automation experiences I have also built CI/CD pipelines to improve
          software quality and development speed by catching defects early in the development process.

          Outside of work, I enjoy continuing to learn software development
          skills through small coding challenges and personal projects.
          Besides interests in software development, I also enjoy
          playing video games, going hiking, and exploring new places.
